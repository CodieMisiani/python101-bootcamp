# Python 101 Bootcamp 🚀
I'm learning Python from the ground up through a hands-on, project-based approach. As I master core programming concepts (variables, functions, loops, etc.), I'm simultaneously building a real-world solo project — a personal expense tracker — to apply everything I learn. This repository documents my journey, code experiments, and evolving project as I progress toward becoming a software engineer skilled in Python.

Welcome to my Python learning journey!  
This repository contains my daily lessons, code experiments, and a real-world solo project — a **Personal Expense Tracker** — built incrementally as I master Python fundamentals.

## 👨‍💻 What You'll Find Here:
- Beginner-friendly Python examples (variables, loops, functions, etc.)
- Daily learning notes and checkpoints
- A live evolving project applying each concept as I learn
- Git workflow with proper branches and commits

## 📌 Project Goal
By the end of this bootcamp, I aim to be confident in Python and ready to build software engineering-level projects with clean, tested, and structured code.
